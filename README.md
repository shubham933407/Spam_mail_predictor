📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the textual content of emails, the model can detect unwanted messages with a high degree of accuracy.

🚀 Project Highlights
Developed a supervised learning pipeline to detect spam emails.

Achieved an accuracy score of 96% using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

Implemented essential NLP preprocessing techniques including:

Text normalization

Tokenization

Stopword removal

TF-IDF vectorization

Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Built a scalable and efficient solution that can be extended to real-time spam detection systems.
